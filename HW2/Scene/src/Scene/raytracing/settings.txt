// how many cube(s) cylinder(s) sphere(s) do you want

cube 1
cylinder 1
sphere 3

// m: distance between camera & projection screen

// n: distance between projection screen & scene box

// t: half of the side length of project screen
// please note that each edge of the scene box ranges from [-1.0, 1.0]
// thus t should be in (0.0, 1.0) ([-t, t] for each edge of the projection screen)
// and (m + n) / m * t should be strictly less than 1.0

// size: the number of pixels each line

m 1.0
n 1.0
t 0.48
size 1200
depth 10
